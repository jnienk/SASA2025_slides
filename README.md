# Dynamic biplot visualisations with  `moveEZ`

Climate change refers to shifts in measured climate conditions and weather patterns over time. In this study, focus is placed on publicly available historical observed climate conditions captured at specific reference regions as stipulated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The associations of climate conditions can be exposed by means of suitable biplot visualisations, with observations in the biplot representing monthly measurements per region and calibrated axes reflect the measured climate conditions. Dynamic plotting techniques available in the R package, `moveEZ`, is applied to enhance interpretability of the changes in conditions over time. These animations sequentially display annual changes in coordinate structures and axis orientations, offering a compelling visualisation of shifting climate patterns. Such dynamic visualisations support intuitive pattern recognition and serve as a powerful communication tool for conveying complex multivariate changes in climate conditions.
